# dj-stripe 2.7.0 (2022-XX-XX)

!!! attention

    It is not possible to upgrade to dj-stripe 2.7.0 from versions older than 2.4.0.
    To upgrade from an older version, first upgrade to dj-stripe 2.4.0.

This release focuses on Webhook Endpoints. For more information on the reasoning behind
the changes, please see the discussion on Github:

<https://github.com/dj-stripe/dj-stripe/discussions/1437>

## Release highlights

-   Webhook Endpoints are now configured via the Django administration.
- Added support for Multiple Webhook Endpoints.
- Added support for `Django 4`.
- Model Instances can be synced from the `Django Admin`.
- Individual model instances can be synced, on any `Stripe Account`, by passing in the appropriate `api_key`.



## Deprecated features

-   The `DJSTRIPE_WEBHOOK_URL` setting is deprecated. It will be removed in dj-stripe
    2.9. It was added to give a way of "hiding" the webhook endpoint URL, but that is no
    longer necessary with the new webhook endpoint system.

## Breaking changes

- Remove the deprecated middleware `djstripe.middleware.SubscriptionPaymentMiddleware`
- djstripe expects `APIKeys` of all Stripe Accounts you'd like to sync data for to already be in the database. They can be added from the `Django Admin`.

## Other changes

- Full support for the following models was added:
    - `Webhook Endpoint`
    - `Order`
    - `Tax Code`
    - `Shipping Rate`

- Webhooks support for `Payout` model was added.
- `djstripe_sync_models` management command now accepts optional parameters to control which models for which `Stripe Accounts` need to be synced. Read the [docs](../usage/manually_syncing_with_stripe.md)
- Remove support for the deprecated `DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REDIRECT` setting
-   Remove support for the `DJSTRIPE_SUBSCRIPTION_REQUIRED_EXCEPTION_URLS` setting
-   Added support for releasing `Subscription Schedules` by using the `SubscriptionSchedule.release()` method.
-   Added support for releasing `Subscription Schedules` from Django-Admin.
-   Added support for cancelling `Subscription Schedules` by using the `SubscriptionSchedule.cancel()` method.
-   Added support for cancelling `Subscription Schedules` from Django-Admin.
- Added support for updating `Subscription Schedules` by using the `SubscriptionSchedule.update()` method.
